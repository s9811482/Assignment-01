Strength: 

Bold – Entertainers aren’t known for holding back. Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, people with the Entertainer personality type don’t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.
Original – Traditions and expectations are secondary to Entertainers, if a consideration at all. Entertainer personalities love to experiment with new styles, and constantly find new ways to stick out in the crowd.
Aesthetics and Showmanship – Not stopping at mere outfits, Entertainers inject artistic creativity into their words and actions, too. Every day is a performance, and Entertainers love to put on a show.
Practical – To Entertainers, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. Truth is stranger than fiction, and Entertainers prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about “what-ifs”.
Observant – With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that Entertainers are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.
Excellent People Skills – More so than things though, Entertainers love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For people with this personality type, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with.
Weaknesses:
Sensitive – Entertainers (especially Turbulent ones) are strongly emotional, and very vulnerable to criticism – they can feel like they’ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably Entertainers greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.
Conflict-Averse – Entertainers sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what’s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.
Easily Bored – Without constant excitement, Entertainers find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things Entertainers get into a little too often.
Poor Long-Term Planners – In fact, Entertainer personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and they rarely bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, with the belief that they could change at any moment – even with things that can be planned.
Unfocused – Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for Entertainers. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects like Classic Literature are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects like psychology. The trick for Entertainers is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals, and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done.


My Project Idea:

My project idea comes here for the business currently i am running for driving scool purpose, which has strong market segment. As a manager I have seek to explore the latest advanced and effective tool leads to the growth of the business, preferences towards cloud-based technologies, introduction of artificial intelligence enabled tools, provision of various benefits such as tracking, consistency along with rising return on my investment. The idea to my business that has the power to 
edit booking orders from Owner App  that can update customer emails and pickup point and drop off point addresses from the order screen in the app. Discover a new and Improved Mobile App to manage my site
for quicker and more efficient way to track analytics, chat with site visitors and run my business on the go. And that reply to blog comments with rich text and that enable comments to enable comments to let them create a conversation around my blog posts. And the App that invite my team to become call agents capability and also that have the capability
to boost my customer service  multiple agents the ability to make and answer calls on my business phone number at the same time and the application
That record calls made to my business phone number and review them any time. which call recordings are seamlessly integrated into my CRM, and  can listen to them from my Inbox. 
I believe Such adoption of advanced and effective tool leads to the growth of my business, preferences towards cloud-based technologies, introduction of artificial intelligence enabled tools, provision of various benefits such as tracking, consistency along with rising return on my investment.
